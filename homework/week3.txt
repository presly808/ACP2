1. Material
    JUnit, Annotations, IO(InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer)
    patterns (Adapter, Decorator)
    protocol TCP/IP, classes(Socket, ServerSocket, URL)

2. To finish stated tasks
    2.1. Saving object cut into files (Was started in class see ProcessAnnotation)
    2.2. Implement loading object from files

3. Write own implementation of Scanner (based on Decorator pattern)
   -String next()
   -int nextInt()
   -String nextLine()
   -boolean hasNext()
   -boolean hasNextInt()
   -useDelemiter(String)
   -close()

4. Write class Timer, that performs some action in defined period of time
   - start(long delay, Action action) // Action is your own interface with one method, for ex. see ActionListener inteface
   - stop()

4. Dynamic sorter
   Sort numbers which are placed in file with defined frequency
   Use class Timer above

5*. Write synchronous chat between two machines (use ServerSocket and Socket)

6*. Write universal downloader from ex.ua (That helps us download all files from page)
    1. First input url address of page
    2. then parse page and find urls like "/load/{idOfFile}" ex. href="/load/124701188"
    3. Take url adn download file using URL class
