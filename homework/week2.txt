1. Theoretical material
    Collections in Java (Map, Queue, TreeSet, TreeMap)
    BinarySearchTree - http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html
    GIT
        basic command - https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf
        book - http://git-scm.com/book/uk
    Reflection API(class Class)
    IDEA setting
    Java(Classpath, ClassLoader)

2. To implement methods of BinarySearchTree in your git branch
            (see https://github.com/presly808/ACP2/blob/master/src/ua/artcode/week2/day1/BinarySearchTree.java)
    * add methods:
        rotateRight
        rotateLeft
            see tree rotation


3. Write classes that will save object(primitive fields or String) into file using
    a) Default Java Serialization (ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream) http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_serialization.htm
    b) Reflection
        file example

            ua.artcode.week1.Employee
            name=Andriy
            salary=2000
            age=25

    .For reading from file use Scanner and for write - PrintWriter

    * Add possibility to save and load several objects(Collection)
    * Hierarchy saving and loading



4. Dont forget about diary.

5. Try to use source code of jdk.

6. Wish you good week. We can do it)
