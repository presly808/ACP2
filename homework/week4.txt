1. Theoretical material for repeating
    Threads synchronization(wait, notify, notifyAll)
    Sockets(ServerSocket, Socket), XML(DOM, SAX), Logging(java.util.logging.*)
    Thread, Runnable, sleep, join, start, synchronized
    class Properties

2. Find file in file system using threads for faster results
    file paths which have been found, save into one common file results.txt

3. Implement asynchronous chat that allows communication with two and more users
    Must have
    - logging (saving history of messages and logging all non-standard situations)
    - read connections setting(port, max users size, list of banned users)
        from server_settings.properties (see class Properties)
    - *  read connections setting(port, max users size, list of banned users)
                 from server_settings.xml (use SAX)
    - send message using Serialization
    -* send message in xml file(generate message using DOM)
    - for better architecture of application see pattern Observer
    - don't forget about Swing(patterns MVC, Listener)


This is task for team work )
